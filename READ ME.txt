This is a repository that handles:
- data preprocessing;
- models' training;
- testing;
for egomotion learning.

Encoders'positions are used to train 5 regressors:
muvx, muvy, sigmavx, sigmavy, sigmavxvy

The learnt models are used for testing.

cornerDetection.m ---> outputs corner events: [ch t pol x y tbottle]
tracker.m ---> outputs flow events: [ch t pol x y tbottle vx vy]
extractStatsForTraining ---> outputs statistics for the training
extractStatsForTesting ---> outputs statistics for testing
computeMahal ---> outputs egomotion events: [ch t pol x y tbottle vx vy mahal_dist]
